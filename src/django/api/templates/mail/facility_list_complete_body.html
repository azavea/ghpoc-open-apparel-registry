      Open Supply Hub List Processing Completed

    <p>
      Hi there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for submitting {{ list_name }} to Open Supply Hub. This list has
      been approved by the OS Hub team and has completed processing. This means
      that all facilities from the list that did not generate errors or require
      additional verification by our team are now live on OS Hub. The admin view
      of your list is now available here:
      <a href="{{ list_url }}">{{ list_url }}</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>One Last Step</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Check for and Resolve Errors or Removed Items: </strong></p>
    <p>
      Click on the list link above and then filter the facilities within your
      list to check for facilities with one of the possible “Error” or “Removed”
      statuses. Facilities with either of these statuses are not published in
      your list on OS Hub.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Errors: </strong>Some entries in your list may have generated an
        error message. You can review these entries to see whether the cause is:
        <ul>
          <li>
            An error in data entry (such as a country name being mis-spelled)
          </li>
          <li>
            Our geo-coder being unable to plot the facility due to the address
            lacking sufficient details, or containing irrelevant information
          </li>
        </ul>
        Check out <a href="http://info.opensupplyhub.org/faqs">our FAQs</a> for
        more information on error types and how to resolve them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Removed Items: </strong>Some facilities in your list may not
        have met quality standards for address information. This could be due
        to:
        <ul>
          <li>Repeating or insufficient elements</li>
          <li>
            Incorrect formatting of additional data fields e.g.
            sector_product_type, faciliity_type_processing_type, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        If you see any items with a “Removed” status, these are items that our
        team reviewed and removed before your list was processed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once you have pin-pointed the cause of the error or removal, update your
      facility information in your Excel/CSV file and re-upload your FULL list
      to the OS Hub again (uploading one facility at a time results in multiple
      lists that are harder to manage in the future). You will be able to
      replace the previous version you uploaded, so only your most recent list
      is available for the public to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have questions or want to learn more about what’s happening when you
      upload your list?

        By claiming their facilities on OS Hub, facility owners or senior
        management can provide facility location data straight from the source,
        as well as add additional details to their profiles, including MOQs,
        lead times, certifications, and more. If you are a brand or organization
        uploading a facility list, you can
